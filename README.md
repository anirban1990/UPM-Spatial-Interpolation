# UPM-Spatial-Interpolation
Python codes and example data for Uncertainty Projected Mapping (UPM) as a spatial interpolation tool

The main code to generate UPM is the 3_generate_UPMs.ipynb. The remaining two codes help generate this code's required inputs when they are unavailable otherwise.

There is also a simple flowchart (How to use the codes?.pdf) on how to use the codes. 
Please also find a file named The UPM story.pdf, which I created to provide an easy recap of UPM.
